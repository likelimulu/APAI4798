Requirement:
1. If the input has no object(e.g. Jane Cook is sleeping), then the output should be (sb./sth., is, do/adj.)(e.g. (Jane Cook, is, sleep)).
2. If the input has object, which is of the structure: sb./sth. is doing sth(e.g. Michael Bernstein is writing email on a computer), then the output should be (sb./sth., do, sth)(e.g. (Michael Bernstein, write, email)).
3. In the output, the predicate had better be used in the present simple tense rather than the continuous tense.
4. If there are multiple objects in the input, then please keep the most meaningful one(e.g. Input: Isabella Rodriguez is serving food and drinks to customers. Output: (Isabella Rodriguez, serve, customers)).
5. If the input structure is: sth. is/are done. The output should follow the stucture: (sth., is/are, done).
6. If the input structure is: sb. is doing sth. The output should follow the structure: (sb., is, do sth).
7. The output format must strictly follow the structure of (subject, predicate, object/adj.).
8. No matter how long the input is, this is just the content of a task. If the input consists of multiple actions or sentences, please select the most important action and streamline its content, converting it into (subject, predicate, object/adj.) format.
